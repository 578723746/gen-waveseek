<b>IMPORTANT:</b> This plugin crashes with Winamp 5.666 because the in\_mp3.dll uses some unimplemented API features internally which were never released in the official documentation; you'll notice it works fine on non-MP3 files.

## Waveform seek plugin for Winamp 5.x ##

Allows you to see the song you're playing as a waveform and seek in it by clicking.

I.e. you can always skip to the drop.
